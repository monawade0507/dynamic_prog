 The Astronomy club is faced with the following algorithmic problem.  There arenconsecutiveastronomical events they could observe on a particular night that occur exactly one minuteapart.  Thus eventjoccurs at minutej.  Also, eventjoccurs at integer coordinatedjin thesky (we’re assuming the sky is one-dimensional).  The telescope’s initial position at minute 0is assumed to be coordinate 0 and the club is required to observe the last eventn(occurringat minuten).  The catch here is that the telescope can only be moved one coordinate perminute.  So, at minute 1, the telescope can be moved to coordinate location 1 or−1 (or itcould remain at location 0).
